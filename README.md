# hello-world


Hi there!

I am new to Github but keen to start learnign more about coding and web development in order to create bit more of an online presence. One of my goals for 2018!

I am a data analyst by profession, working in public health, with a background in GIS. I like to make maps but want to start creating more web maps and bespoke applications.
